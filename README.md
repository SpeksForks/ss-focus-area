Focus Area Field
======
**Focus Area Field** is a new form field and db field combo that allows you to select a portion of a page/image, and saves the percentage values of X1,X2,Y1,Y2, so you can position a div on top of it.

It is inspired by the [Focus Point Module](https://github.com/jonom/silverstripe-focuspoint), I needed it for some sliders where the position of content is not always the same.

## Install
Add the following to your composer.json file

```

    "require"          : {
		"milkyway-multimedia/ss-focus-area": "dev-master"
	}

```

## Recommended
I recommend the [Focus Point Module](https://github.com/jonom/silverstripe-focuspoint) by jonathonmenz.com, simply because it is an awesome module that allows you to crop to a certain focus point.
